# About Chinese Content and English Content

## First, there are differences between the Chinese and English contents

- For famous quotes or contents with cultural backgrounds, etc...
    - I think keeping it as it is is the best strategy.

- For most articles, I'll use ChatGPT 3.5 for translation, and do my best to proofread the articles with my poor English skills.
    - I will indicate in the article that it is translated by ChatGPT 3.5.

- For some articles, I will use different expressions to express the same content or central idea.

## So don't use it to learn English

- Except for the English series under the Chinese content,

For other articles, if it is not indicated that it is translated by ChatGPT 3.5, it is not recommended to use it as a reference for English materials. It is recommended to read it in an all-English environment and maintain your English sense.
