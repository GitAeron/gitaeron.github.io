      <description>Letter from Hu Shi to his son: I have raised you not out of favor, but as a biological instinct of kinship. Therefore, since I am not favored by you, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to repay me.
Rather, I have to thank you, because with your participation, my life is more complete.
I just happened to be your father, and you just happened to be my daughter or son. I am not your prequel, and you are not my sequel.</description>
