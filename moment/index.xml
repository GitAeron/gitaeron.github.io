      <description>I got thanatophobia.
Started in 2018, when I was just 16.
It stayed with me through the years.
And continuing for the rest of my life, until I died.
However, I will not give up fighting it, and I will continue to do so for the rest of my life.
We are born with nothing, and we leave alone.
In this short life, the most precious thing is the journey of life itself.</description>
